<p>Crash: This short piece - film, was an attempt to visualize my poem "Crash", through minimal use of Adobe After Effects, while communicating the mood of each segment through the music and colors. I chose to use a computerized female voice to read the poem as it best portrayed for the payoff in the final act. Finding new ways of expressing things has always been one of my favorite pursuits.</p>

<p>Open; is a highly experimental, abstract film. The protagonist's mind races with the things he thought about from his last night out, and the monologue is contraster with his point of view of waking up the next day and not knowing where or how he got there. I attempt to portray the disconnect that the character feels, sinking into the illusion.</p>

<p>Overwritten: One man returns to his past to kill his former self before he can commit any of his eventual sins, but does he end up creating the monster he came to slay? Overwritten is a film that seeks to raise questions about inevitability and free will. It is also an experiment in paradox and the nature of events to create themselves. We had to work on an extremely limited time frame, and with very limited resources. I hope to re-imagine this short in the future.</p>
